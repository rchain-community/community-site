There are three versions of the Uniswap protocol (v1, v2, and v3), each of which is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. Your use of the Uniswap protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being supplied to the Uniswap protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Before using the Uniswap protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the Uniswap protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email email protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the Uniswap protocol through dozens of web or mobile interfaces.
